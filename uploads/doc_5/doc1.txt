The gut–brain connection is a sophisticated communication network linking the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This dialogue happens through multiple channels, including the vagus nerve, immune system signals, and chemical messengers such as neurotransmitters. For instance, the gut microbiota produces metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, which can influence mood, cognition, and even behavior by interacting with neural pathways. Scientific research increasingly points to the bidirectional nature of this relationship—stress can disrupt digestion, while gut imbalances can contribute to anxiety or depression. Understanding this system offers a promising frontier for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders through dietary interventions, probiotics, and targeted microbiome therapies.
